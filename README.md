# Intercollegiate Programming Competition 2021
*Solutions for Seminole State's Intercollegiate Programming Competition 2021 (Blue Track)*

On April 10, 2021, I participated in this competition in the Blue Track, winning first place.
The problems can be found [here](https://www.seminolestate.edu/computers/competition/samples/2021).
According to the points, one of these solutions is incorrect. While all of my solutions worked properly to my knowledge, I haven't been informed which problem I got wrong, so... happy hunting!
